Step 1: Pick five crypto sectors
There are any number of sectors in the crypto world: coins used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, coins powering the metaverse, coins associated with artificial intelligence, file-sharing, gaming – the list goes on and on.

So the first step in our strategy – which we'll call the "dual momentum crypto strategy" (you'll see why later) – is to select five different sectors from the links above that have compelling investment cases. I’ve gone with smart contracts (key enablers of blockchains), DeFi (disrupting the finance industry), NFTs (unlocking more value for creators), metaverse (potential future of the web), and decentralized exchanges (essential for crypto trading).

We’ll allocate an equal amount (20%) of our crypto portfolio to each of the five sectors. And for each sector, the strategy will either select the best-performing coin in that sector or cash (you’ll see how in a minute).

Step 2: Calculate your momentum scores
For each of the sectors, calculate a momentum score for the five biggest coins by market value. The momentum score is calculated by averaging the coin’s price return over the past seven, 30, 60, and 90 days, and you can find it by going to CoinMarketCap, clicking on filter, and setting the coin category to one of the sectors you’ve chosen (decentralized exchange in the example below).

Then click on customize and select the “7d%”, “30d%”, “60d%”, and “90d%” metrics as shown below, and hit “apply changes”.

You’ll see the coins’ price returns over the past seven, 30, 60, and 90 days. Finally, just take the average of these four data points for the top five coins in the list, since they also happen to be the five biggest coins (CoinMarketCap lists coins in descending order of market value).

Step 3: Use dual momentum to determine your final portfolio
Dual momentum refers to two types of momentum: relative and absolute. Relative momentum measures how an asset has performed relative to other assets over a certain time period, while absolute momentum measures whether an asset has actually risen in value over a certain period of time. Dual momentum is a well-known investment strategy within the academic and investment communities.

So our dual momentum crypto strategy means investing in the best-performing coin in the sector (relative momentum), but only if its recent returns are positive (absolute momentum). If neither of these criteria is met, the strategy calls to shift the amount that would’ve been invested in that coin to cash.

For example, below is the list of the five biggest coins belonging to the smart contracts sector, and their respective returns.

And below is each one’s momentum score.

Momentum scores
Avalanche (AVAX) has the highest momentum score of 29.6% out of the lot, so we select this coin from the smart contracts sector. And because 29.6% is positive, we’ll put 20% of our crypto portfolio in it. If its momentum score was negative, we’d put the 20% into cash instead. Repeat this exercise for each of the five sectors you selected in step one.

After doing this, you could end up in a portfolio with 20% invested in each of the top-performing coins by sector, or in a portfolio fully invested in cash if all the coins are experiencing a downtrend, or something in between. Moving into cash to avoid investing in falling coins is how this strategy tries to avoid big investment drawdowns.

Step 4: Hold till the end of the month and rebalance
Hold this crypto portfolio till the end of the month, then, on the last day of the month, go back and repeat the three steps above. So this strategy essentially trades and rebalances monthly.

Note that I say monthly here because that’s how often most tactical asset allocation strategies rebalance. But I’m aware how fast things move in the crypto world, so I’m not against tweaking this strategy to trade and rebalance weekly. Best to experiment and see what makes the most sense for you.
