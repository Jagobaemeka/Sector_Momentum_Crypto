#Pick five crypto sectors
#Allocate an equal amount of 20% to each of the five sectors
#Strategy will pick best performing ones.
#Calculate your momentum scores For each of the sectors, calculate a momentum score for the five biggest coins by market value.
# The momentum score is calculated by averaging the coinâ€™s price return over the past seven, 30, 60, and 90 days.
#Use dual momentum to determine your final portfolio Dual momentum refers to two types of momentum: relative and absolute. 
#Relative momentum measures how an asset has performed relative to other assets over a certain time period, while absolute momentum measures whether an asset has actually risen in value over a certain period of time.
#Hold till the end of the month and rebalance Hold this crypto portfolio till the end of the month, then, on the last day of the month,
#go back and repeat the three steps above. So this strategy essentially trades and rebalances monthly.
